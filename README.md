# SeniorSpot
Principles of Software Engineering, Spring 2019 group project.

I was the front-end developer of this project. This is a website that allows senior citizens to become more involve in their communities. 

The website opens up to the login page. Returning users log in, while new users are able to sign up. After entering credentials, a list of upcoming events are displayed. Users are able to see the details for each events which include the total number and who are the attendees. They then join or decline events.
